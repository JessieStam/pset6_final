**TBR Jar App**

*Door Jessie Stam*

A TBR Jar is a "jar" in which you put the booktitles of books you still want to read: the to-be-read books. When you find yourself without
a book, simply look into this jar to find a new book to start! This is the concept that I used for this application. When the app is first
created, it asks the user to log in or sign up, using Google Firebase. When the user is logged in, he can then use the toolbar icons to
navigate around the application. By clicking the search icon, the user can input a book title, author's name or ISBN code to search the
library. Using the Goodreads Api, the app then returns a list of approximately twenty books. By clicking on one of these result, the app
moves to a new Activity, on which more book details are displayed. This acitivity also allows the user, by clicking on the add to list
button, to add the book to a list. When this button is clicked, four more buttons containing the list titles, will be displayed. By clicking one of these the book will be added to the corresponding list, that is if that list doesn't contain an item for that book already. When the user clicks the list icon in the toolbar, a drop down menu lets him choose between the lists. Clicking on one of those opens the list. Again, when a book is clicked, further details will be displayed, along with the option to add the book to a list. By clicking the account button in the toolbar, the user will be taken back to MainActivity, were he can sign out and log in or sign up with a different account. Because the application remember which user is logged in, every user can have their own lists.

Unfortunately I was a bit too ambitious with this application, resulting in my app having some minor flaws. For example, I wanted the user to be able to remove books from the list. I also wanted to use Google Firebase to save the data, so this data doesn't have to be stored in the application itself. I hope that the things that do work make up for the things that don't. Thanks for your attention.
